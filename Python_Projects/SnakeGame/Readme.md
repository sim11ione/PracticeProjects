## Overview

The aim of this project is to create a Snake game that was first played on Nokia phones of the 2000's era. The game is exactly according to that game where the snake gets bigger as it eats the food and the game ends when the snake bites itself or touches the borders of the screen.

The Python Turtle module was used to make this game.
