## Overview
The aim of this thesis was to make a user friendly demand forecasting model based on time series data (.i.e. Data at a partiular time period) using machine learining. The model studies the past data, identifies patterns and other parameters to forecast the demand for future time periods.

## Methods used to creating the forecasting model
1) Holt-Winters method.
2) (Seasonal) Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average method (SARIMA).
3) TPOT Regressor - An automated machine learning tool that automatically runs pipelines and selects the best ML method.

*Note: An ensemble of these three methods (taken as the average) was used as the final result.*

## Tools used
1) Python - Used for the main forcasting and machine learning logic.
2) HTML - To make the user interface application.
3) Java Script - To make connections to the server and have inputs to the UI.
4) MS Excel - For storing the time series data to be sourced for the logic.

## Dataset
The Data set used was from a pharmaceutical distribution company in India for three of their SKU's. The data set can be found in this file.
